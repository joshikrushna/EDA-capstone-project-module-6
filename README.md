Developing an Advanced Movie Recommender System for Netflix
Objective
Design and implement an intelligent, data-driven movie recommender system to deliver personalized content recommendations, enhancing user experience and optimizing platform performance.

Business Goals
Personalized User Experience:

Develop a recommendation engine using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models to provide tailored movie suggestions.

Enhance user satisfaction and engagement through accurate content recommendations.

Content Optimization:

Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences, viewing patterns, and historical data.

Maximize content discoverability by promoting a diverse range of movies aligned with user interests.

Business Growth and Retention:

Implement predictive analytics to anticipate user preferences and recommend relevant content.

Drive customer retention and increase watch time through intelligent content suggestions.

Support data-driven decision-making for content acquisition and personalized marketing campaigns.

Technical Approach
Data Collection and Processing:

Aggregate and preprocess user interaction data, including viewing history, search behavior, ratings, and watch duration.

Model Development:

Utilize collaborative filtering (user-user and item-item) and content-based filtering to predict user preferences.

Implement hybrid recommendation systems to overcome individual model limitations.

Evaluation and Optimization:

Apply metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Precision/Recall to evaluate model accuracy.

Continuously optimize model performance using A/B testing and user feedback.

Expected Impact
Improved content personalization leading to higher user engagement and satisfaction.

Increased content consumption and visibility of underutilized films.

Enhanced decision-making for content acquisition and marketing.

Greater customer retention, supporting long-term business growth.

Results
Optimal Cluster Selection:

Applied the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters for segmenting the data.

Achieved effective clustering by grouping similar movies based on user preferences and viewing patterns.

Recommendation System Development:

Implemented a movie recommender system using Cosine Similarity to measure the similarity between movies.

Leveraged the identified clusters to enhance recommendation accuracy, suggesting movies from similar categories.

Outcome:

The recommendation system provides personalized movie suggestions by analyzing both content similarity and cluster-based associations.

Improved recommendation relevance, contributing to enhanced user satisfaction and increased engagement.

Conclusion
Data Preprocessing and Analysis:

Conducted comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on all dataset features.

Applied necessary transformations and evaluated categorical variables for clustering suitability.

Performed Monovariate and Bivariate analysis to examine variable distributions and relationships.

Analyzed numerical variables, calculated correlations, and studied their impact on the dependent variable.

Clustering Approach:

Employed two machine learning algorithms:

K-Means Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative Clustering)

Used the Silhouette Score and Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Key Insights:

Content Distribution: Netflix's content library comprises 69.1% movies and 30.9% TV shows, with a substantial focus on movies.

Regional Dominance: The United States contributes significantly to Netflix's growing collection of TV shows and movies.

Feature Selection for Clustering:

Selected six key attributes â€” director, cast, country, genre, rating, and description for clustering.

Optimal Clusters:

K-Means Clustering:

Elbow method indicated 6 clusters as optimal.

Silhouette score analysis suggested an optimal cluster count of 13.

Agglomerative Clustering:

The dendrogram visualization confirmed an optimal cluster count of 9.

These insights were instrumental in building a more accurate, content-driven movie recommender system. The clustering results enabled personalized recommendations, enhancing user satisfaction and increasing platform engagement.
